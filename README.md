In order to execute this project,

1. Connect the arduino board to the system. 
2. Open sketch_d.ino file using an Arduino IDE. Select the Arduino UNO Board and the available port. 
3. Open a terminal, navigate to the location of the python file. Change the port name in the python code to the port that the Arudino is connected to your system.
4. Verify and upload the Arduino code to the board in the Arduino IDE. Plug the battery of the XY plane to a power outlet. The XY plane initially calibrates by moving to the position(0,0).
5. In the terminal, run the python code using the command python checkers.py . The XY plane recalibrates.
6. Play the moves and enjoy the game!
